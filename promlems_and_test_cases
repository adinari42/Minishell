grep -Hirn "parse error" .	(quotes problem, outputs lines that don't contain parse error)
echo "'$USER'"				(throws an error about unclosed quotes, should output 'adinari' or 'slakner' instead)

minishell sometimes 'hangs' and does not display the next prompt after input. Seems to happen after an unclose quotes error, but I'm not sure.

echo "'"					(error about unclosed quotes)
echo "'$USER'"				(doesn't segfault, but also throws the unclosed quotes error)
echo "foo"   "foo"			(too many spaces in the output)
