export a=1 | cat 			(does not behave like bash, bash does not export the variable and does not block/'hang')
grep -Hirn "parse error" .	(quotes problem, outputs lines that don't contain parse error)
echo "'$USER'"				(throws an error about unclosed quotes, should output 'adinari' or 'slakner' instead)
echo "foo ||||				(segfaults, unclosed quotes)
minishell sometimes 'hangs' and does not display the next prompt after input. Seems to happen after an unclose quotes error, but I'm not sure.

echo "'"					(error about unclosed quotes)
